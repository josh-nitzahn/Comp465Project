Unfortunately, we were not able to include the MinGW program folder necessary for command-line compilation in this upload, due to the 50 MB limit (minGW is 200+ MB)

If you wish to run the program using MinGW, you may download the exact program files we used by downloading the zip file from this web address:

Make sure that the MinGW folder is in the same location as the 'includes465' and 'warbird' folders.
